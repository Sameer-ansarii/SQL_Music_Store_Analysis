# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis

This SQL project involved analyzing data from a music store to gain insights and make informed decisions. The project included three question sets: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced. The Easy set covered topics such as employee hierarchy, top countries based on invoices, and best customers. The Moderate set focused on rock music listeners, top rock bands, and longer tracks. The Advanced set delved into customer spending on artists, popular genres by country, and top-spending customers by country. Through this project, I showcased my SQL skills and provided valuable insights for the music store's operations, customer behavior, and marketing strategies.
